## The Challenge
###### UI/UX Designer
<p></p>
Justia's Verdict offers thoughtful, original, and highly informed analysis of breaking news and developments in the law and politics from law professors and legal pundits.

This blog was designed in 2008 and was very outdated, the interface was confusing and cluttered, and the users had a difficult time scanning quickly through the news. Font, spacing and the poor usage of visual hierarchy made the website very difficult to scan for users that were looking for a specific article. 

<h6> Original </h6>

## The Solution

A new reading experience that users found comfortable when browsing articles. The redesign met accessibility guidelines, was responsive and hierarchy was better applied, this made users engage more with the website and made information more accessible for people with specific needs.
