## The Challenge
###### UI/UX Designer
<p></p>
Justia is an American website specializing in legal information, is one of the largest online databases of legal cases. The website offers free case law, codes, opinion summaries, and other basic legal texts, with paid services for its attorney directory and web hosting.

Justia had a very simple and straightforward website to showcase their services, but visually wasn't attractive, and it didn’t showcase the design possibilities they offered. **The new website was required to be descriptive, informative, and attractive enough to boost sales.**

## The Solution

Blue was the main identifier to Justia’s brand, and we wanted to keep consistency across all the websites. We wanted this website to be like a story we were telling the potential clients, and we wanted **the experience to be seamless and to be engaging enough to make them want to work with us.**
