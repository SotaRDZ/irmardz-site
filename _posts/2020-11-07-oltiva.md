## The Challenge
###### Project Manager/Creative Direction

<p></p>
A global franchise fast-food restaurant challenged us for a solution to help “Create a strong sense of brand belonging through an outstanding digital employee experience and co-create feel good moments for every customer” to address low employee engagement and 167% attrition rate.

## The Design

Our Microsoft Teams based WX Hub for Retail provides frontline employees with a user-friendly, personalized mobile platform that delivers corporate, customer and operational insights, enabling employees to become brand ambassadors and deliver a better and more integrated sales experience.

The Teams WX Hub also empowers store management to better schedule, train and motivate their employees through communications, promotions and contests. All while controlling frontline employee costs.
