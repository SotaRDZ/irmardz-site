## The Challenge
###### Project Manager/Creative Direction

<p></p>
Patients in isolation can’t communicate with loved ones. ​Even families for patients undergoing non-COVID related procedures (e.g. patients in labor) aren’t allowed in patient rooms.​

Nurses and hospital staff help patients with calls using the patient’s or staff’s personal devices, supporting these calls is difficult for staff on high tempo rotations, and the influx of consumer-grade communication tools (FaceTime, Facebook) taxes hospital networks.​

## The Proposal

Simple interface lets patients talk to loved ones,​ using Teams as a secure, robust communication platform, Virtual Visits makes it easy for patients to speak with family and friends who can’t visit the hospital.​
