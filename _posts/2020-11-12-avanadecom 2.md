## The Challenge
###### Interaction/Motion Designer
<p></p>
The main brand of the company I just joined 2 months earlier was being redesigned. We were given 3 weeks to ideate and deliver the first approach for the Avanade brand refresh featuring the new look and feel.

## The Brief

## The Ideation

Features were already defined, our job was to bring a new life to an old site, making minor adjustments and within a minimal time frame over the first quarter of the year. We started by making a thorough audit of the website and looked for references for every one of the components used. We used benchmarking for the UX and mood boarding for the UI.

## The Design

The approved design met our main objectives as UX designers, of making content easy to scan, seamless navigation and hierarchy to be easily identifiable, our website proposal combined the requirements we had from our stakeholders:

- Optimistic 
- Bold 
- Fresh
- Passionate

## The Iteration

We tested all of our proposals against accessibility guidelines, but after deployment, Avanade’s Accessibility team gave us an audit of all the site, we had to iterate to make sure that every element of the design met ADA guidelines and is accessible to all users, including those with disabilities

One problem we didn’t have in mind with designing was, how the website would look for people with other alphabets. A few months after deployment, we were contacted by Emiko Umeno, a Japanese designer also working for Avanade who gave us very useful feedback that we couldn’t have gotten by doing research. Her collaboration and guidance when working for CJK fonts were very insightful and made an impact on how I’ve been tackling international projects since then.

## The Goodbye

This was the first time I took ownership of a project and it was very difficult from me to move on from it, I still see changes made after I left and think how I would’ve done it since I created the look and feel. But I’ve come to realize that different people working on the project it’s what makes it feel alive and what gives room for continous iteration. 

If it weren’t for an outside perspective as Emiko’s we probably couldn’t fix those issues for the Japanese users, so a fresh and new perspective is very needed on project as complex as this one.
