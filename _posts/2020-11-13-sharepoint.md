## The Research

We went out to conduct ethnographic research and search for what the users need on the intranet. What was the most used feature, and what the business goals were to make an intranet with a holistic approach? We wanted this site to be the main channel the employers and the company had a conversation.

## The Ideation

We started designing with a blue sky approach, we were not thinking of frameworks, budgets, or other limitations. But when we started thinking of where the app would live we had to adapt it to Sharepoint. Avanade is a Microsoft partner, and Sharepoint just had introduced customizable SharePoint sites, which we took as a great opportunity to met our business and experience goals.

## The Design

Avanade’s new intelligent intranet hub is a key part of our employee experience journey - connecting disparate systems and processes to make our people’s lives easier and more informed. ​

The goal is to help make our people feel inspired, confident and cared for in our virtual Avanade world – connecting people and information so they’re more informed and better equipped to do their job.

## The Documentation

This project had a lot of customization and personalization, because of this we had to do a lot of documentation for SharePoint developers to make sure the functionalities we were defining were correctly translated to the platform.
